    "# Labs 5\n",
    "\n",
    "This set of labs is going to be a little different from the others. Instead of coding a number of things from scratch, there are a number of notebooks in the Labs5 folder that you will use. In terms of what I want you to hand in, it should be a single pdf, with figures created from the different notebooks. Each lab will include one part answering questions about the code and what it does, and the second part will be doing some experiments with the notebook itself. It might be easier to try running the code a couple times with different parameters before answering the first part.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome to make that pdf with whatever software you like, although if you want to make it using a jupyter notebook the following might be useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. to save a figure in python you can use ```plt.savefig('figureLocationAndName.png')```\n",
    "2. to include an image in a markdown cell you can use ```<img src=\"figureLocationAndName.png\" height=100% width=100%>``` and obviously you can change height and width to make sure it fits in the notebook. "

    "\n",
    "This code uses the KalmanFilter.ipynb notebook. The notebook does something very similar to the class notes, but instead of using a 1DOU process it uses a stochastic oscillator. The idea is that we generate 1 realization of the process we want to estimate, add some noise to it in order to create observations, and then try to estimate the initial realization from the noisy, subsampled observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the notebook generates a new realization everytime it is run, you might want to try rerunning it a few times for each experiment you do. \n",

    "1. Try running the filter with the default parameters, what do you notice about the estimation of component 0 vs component 1? What do the error bars represent in each case?\n",
    "2. What happens if you set tau=0.25? Why did this happen? What other parameters could you change to improve the estimate?\n",
    "3. reset tau=1. What happens if you change the value of R?\n",
    "4. What happens if you change the Hobs array? Good things to experiment with are using both observations, either independently or taking the mean of both. \n",

The original model is a spectrally truncated version of buoyantly forced turbulence, the parameters here are the \"classic\" values that have chaotic behavior. Chaos in the context of the model can be interpreted as aperiodic jumping between the left and right sides of the domain (in $x_0$). This behavior, the aperiodic switching between apparent cyclic attractors, is characteristic of a \"strange attractor\", which chaos theory more or less exists to study. \n",

    "The classic version of the model comes from choosing $D=0$. In this case the model will show strong sensitivity to the initial conditions. However, with the stochastic forcing there is no longer strong sensitivity to the initial conditions, since there is random perturbations at every time step, so rerunning the model with exactly the initial condition will result in drastically different simulations.\n",

    "3. What happens when you change the number of ensemble members? \n",
    "4. What happens when you change the sampling rate of the observations?\n",
    "5. What happens as you increase the value of D? (try using D=5 for instance).\n",
